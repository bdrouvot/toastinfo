The SPEC file found here is intended to be
used with PGDG PostgreSQL packages. To build a
toastinfo package, you have to specify the target
PostgreSQL PGDG release and the installation directory,
where the packages can be found.

Example:

rpmbuild -D"pgdgversion 10" -D "pginstdir /usr/pgsql-10/" -ba toastinfo.spec
